## 4. Automated Testing Procedures

### 4.1 Unit Testing
- Run unit tests for all components
- Verify code coverage (aim for >80%)
- Run tests in isolation to catch component-level issues

### 4.2 Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Verify data flow between modules
- Test database operations

### 4.3 End-to-End Testing
Execute the end-to-end testing script:
```bash
cd scripts
npm install
npm run test:e2e
```

This script tests:
- Authentication flow
- Department management
- Host management
- Visitor management
- Visit lifecycle
- Analytics data
- Dashboard functionality

### 4.4 API Testing
Test all API endpoints for:
- Correct status codes
- Proper response structure
- Error handling
- Authentication requirements
- Rate limiting behavior

### 4.5 Deployment Testing
Execute the deployment testing script:
```bash
./scripts/test-deployment.sh [base_url] [admin_email] [admin_password]
```

This script validates:
- Application health
- Database connectivity
- Authentication
- Core API functionality
- Static asset delivery

## 5. Regression Testing

Perform regression testing when:
- New features are added
- Bugs are fixed
- Dependencies are updated
- Configuration changes are made

Regression test checklist:
1. Run all automated tests
2. Manually test core user flows
3. Verify fixed bugs don't reappear
4. Check for unintended side effects

## 6. Performance Testing

### 6.1 Load Testing
- Simulate concurrent users (start with 50, increase to 200)
- Measure response times under load
- Identify bottlenecks
- Test database query performance

### 6.2 Stress Testing
- Push the system beyond normal operation
- Test recovery from overload
- Verify error handling under stress
- Monitor resource utilization

### 6.3 Endurance Testing
- Run the system for extended periods (24+ hours)
- Monitor for memory leaks
- Check database connection stability
- Verify scheduled tasks execute properly

## 7. Security Testing

### 7.1 Authentication Security
- Test password strength requirements
- Verify account lockout policies
- Test token-based authentication
- Check session management

### 7.2 Authorization Testing
- Verify role-based permissions
- Test access to protected resources
- Verify department-based restrictions
- Check for privilege escalation possibilities

### 7.3 Input Validation
- Test for SQL injection
- Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- Test for CSRF protection
- Verify input sanitization

### 7.4 Data Protection
- Verify sensitive data encryption
- Test secure transmission (HTTPS)
- Verify proper error handling (no sensitive info in errors)
- Test backup and restore procedures

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

The testing is considered successful when:

1. All automated tests pass with no failures
2. Manual test procedures complete without critical issues
3. Performance meets the following criteria:
   - Page load time < 2 seconds
   - API response time < 500ms
   - System handles 100+ concurrent users
   - No memory leaks detected
4. Security testing reveals no critical or high vulnerabilities
5. The application works correctly on all supported browsers
6. The system can run stably for at least 48 hours
7. All deployment procedures work as expected

## 9. Bug Reporting Procedure

When issues are found during testing:

1. Document the issue with clear steps to reproduce
2. Include environment details (browser, OS, etc.)
3. Add screenshots or video if applicable
4. Classify the severity:
   - **Critical**: System unusable, data loss, security breach
   - **High**: Major feature broken, significant impact on users
   - **Medium**: Feature partially broken, workaround exists
   - **Low**: Minor issue, cosmetic problems, rare edge cases
5. Assign to the appropriate team member
6. Track resolution in the issue tracking system

## 10. Test Documentation

Maintain the following test documentation:
- Test plans and procedures (this document)
- Test case specifications
- Test logs and results
- Bug reports and resolution status
- Test coverage reports
- Performance test results

Update this documentation as the system evolves to ensure testing procedures remain current and effective.
